1. What problem does the context API help solve?

    Context API helps with getting data to where it is needed instead of prop dilling.

1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

    Store is known as the 'single source of truth' because it is where all the date is stored. Reducers help manage state that is withen the date. Actions are used to change the state.

1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

    Application state is global while component state is local. So if you are trying to change something that is local then you should use a component state rather than a application state.

1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

    Redux thunk lets you write action creators that return functions instead of actions.

1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

    I prefer redux because so far I understand how to set it up and how to use it.
